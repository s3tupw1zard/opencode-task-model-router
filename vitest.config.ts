//   published package (files: ["src/", ...]) can never ship tests (plan C4).
// - The default run excludes `test/smoke/**`: those are opt-in real-OpenCode
//   smokes gated behind RUN_OC_SMOKE=1 (run via `npm run smoke`).
// - Coverage source is `src/`. Thresholds are wired but intentionally left
//   non-failing in Wave 0; they are turned on in Phase 5.1.
