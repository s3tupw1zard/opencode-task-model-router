/**
 * Smoke test: Layer-2 acceptance gate (Option i verify-dispatch) end-to-end.
 *
 * Exercises the real `opencode run` path with TASK_MODEL_ROUTER_ENFORCE=1.
 * The prompt asks the orchestrator to dispatch a fast subagent whose task text
 * embeds an [acceptance] block with a deterministic fileExists check for a
 * file that DOES NOT exist (__definitely_missing_artifact__.txt).  Because
 * that file is absent, Option(i) verify-dispatch should detect a DoD failure
 * and append a forcing note whose first line contains "NOT ACCEPTED".
 *
 * GATED: runs only when RUN_OC_SMOKE=1 is set.
 * Excluded from default `npm test` by vitest.config.ts exclude pattern.
 * Run explicitly:
 *   $env:RUN_OC_SMOKE='1'
 *   npx vitest run --config vitest.smoke.config.ts test/smoke/layer2-gate.smoke.test.ts
 *
 * Tolerant assertion strategy (3 lines):
 *   1. No task tool call in output (orchestrator refusal) → console.warn +
 *      SOFT-PASS; GA-3 is deterministically covered by layer2-wiring.test.ts.
 *   2. Task dispatched + "NOT ACCEPTED" present → hard PASS (ideal case).
 *   3. Task dispatched + "NOT ACCEPTED" absent (model dropped acceptance block)
 *      → console.warn + SOFT-PASS; this is orchestrator non-compliance, not a
 *      gate regression — never a false CI failure.
